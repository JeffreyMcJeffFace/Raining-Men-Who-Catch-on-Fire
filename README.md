# Raining-Men-Who-Catch-on-Fire
Click a button and a man falls from the sky and burns on impact. 

Using jQUERY I made this to practice event handling and CSS manipulation. 

I wanted to add rotation to the little men as they fell, but you can't use the animate function with jQUERY because those are not numerical only CSS attributes. :(  You would have to use an interval timer, but then a bunch of stuff has to be re-worked, but maybe I'll do it one day.

Note: Mobile support is terrible! The clouds go way off screen due to positioning and mess stuff up. Needs some work.
